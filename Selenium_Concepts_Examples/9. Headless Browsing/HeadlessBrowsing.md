# <span style="color:teal;">**Headless Browsing**
Headless browsing refers to running a web browser without a graphical user interface. This is particularly useful for automated testing or web scraping when you don't need to visually interact with the browser. In Selenium, you can enable headless mode when launching the browser.   

Here's an example using Python and Chrome WebDriver:
```python

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

# Create ChromeOptions object
chrome_options = Options()

# Enable headless mode
chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")

# Instantiate the WebDriver with ChromeOptions
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path/to/chromedriver.exe', options=chrome_options)

# Example: Perform actions in headless mode
driver.get("https://www.example.com")
print("Title of the page:", driver.title)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

```

**Note:** Headless browsing is beneficial for scenarios where the graphical user interface is not required, such as automated testing or web scraping. By configuring ChromeOptions to enable headless mode, you can achieve faster script execution and reduced resource consumption. It's important to test your scripts thoroughly in headless mode to ensure compatibility with the features you're utilizing.
